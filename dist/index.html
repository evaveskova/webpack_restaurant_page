      <h1>The World's Greatest Restaurant</h1>

      <p>
        Do you like food? Great! Because we have lots of it. That's because
        we're a restaurant, and restaurants serve food.

      <p>
        We've been around since 1202, starting out as a small pub that serves
        sheep's intenstines, to a renowed, 5-star establishment with
        delightful, overpriced, tiny food. Enjoy!
